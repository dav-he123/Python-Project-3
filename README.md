# Video Game Sales Analysis using Python

This is an analysis to determine if the average global sales was higher before or after 2005 by using Python and MySql. Data verification was completed in MySql in order to ensure that all the records are correctly stored and structured to obtain accurate results in the end. Data cleaning, cleansing, and preprocessing was completed in Python to ensure the dataset is consistent and accurate by removing duplicates, handling missing values, and refining the data. Data analysis to determine the average global sales before and after 2005 was completed in Python as well.
