# Video Game Sales Analysis using Python

This is an analysis to determine if the average global sales was higher before or after 2005 by using Python and MySql. Data testing and verification was completed in MySql in order to ensure that all the records are correctly stored and structured to obtain accurate results in the end. Data cleaning, cleansing, and preprocessing was completed in Python to ensure the dataset is consistent and accurate by removing duplicates, handling missing values, and refining the data. Data analysis to determine the average global sales before and after 2005 was completed in Python as well. The project consists of 2 main parts, the first part is to determine if the average global sales is higher before and after 2005. The second part is to add a column to display a label of pre and post 2005 for all the required records.

# Running the tests

The testing of Project 3 will begin in MySQL workbench using SQL commands.

## Breakdown of Tests
```
1. An initial excel file containing the data for Video Game Sales is obtained.
2. Convert the file into a CSV file.
3. Import the CSV file into MySQL by right clicking on the database being used and click on Table Data Import Wizard as shown in the screenshot below.
4. Follow through with the steps of loading the data of the CSV file into a table within the database in MySQL.
```

<pre>
</pre>

After the data is loaded into a table in the database. The testing of the data can begin by extracting the requried data using SQL commands.

```
Testing first part of Project 3 to obtain average global sales before and after 2005:

1. Type in SQL commands to obtain the average global sales before and after 2005.
2. Execute the SQL command.
3. The required answer is displayed in the console in the bottom of the screenshot shown below.
```

```
Testing second part of Project 3 to add in column to display pre and post 2005 for the required records:

1. Type in SQL commands to add in a column to display pre and post 2005 for the required records.
2. Execute the SQL command.
3. The required answer is displayed in the console in the bottom of the screenshot shown below.

# Execute SQL Script in MySQL

Here is how to execute SQL Script in MySQL.

1. Make sure you are using the correct table in your database.
2. Once the SQL command implemented. Click the lightning bolt button circled in red in the screenshot.
3. If the SQL command executes successfully your result will display in the result grid labelled with a red arrow in the screenshot below.
